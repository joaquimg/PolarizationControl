# PolarizationControl

Code for the simulation described in the paper: "An Optimal Polarization Tracking Algorithm for Lithium-Niobate-based Polarization Controllers", which can be found at: [arXiv:1603.06751](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06751v1.pdf)

Also a video resulting from such simulation is at [Optoelectronics Laboratory - PUC-Rio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmB0Fkgg9_M) channel in youtube.
